3074457347111866011,"this is a good idea though the execution is poor. i don't know if i'm missing it though i only see the ability to write one continuous set of notes.

i saw all the templates and thought ""great! i was actually going to build all of these, now i can use them together"" but when i clicked on one, i realized i couldn't go back and add another one.

for example - i want to see the notes section broken down into spaces where i have my agenda at the top, followed by different activities and their frames, followed by a checklist, followed by a workshop summary.

👉properly formatted so they feel like different sections and not one long apple notes document.👈

even if i could easily recreate each of the templates, once i start one, i wanted to look at the other options (the gray ghost template examples) but realized i couldn't do that unless i deleted everything. so i had to open each template, copy all the text, paste it in apple notes, and then start one note and re-paste them all in there.

also i have no idea what the pin button means at the top, i have no idea what the man and pen icon means at the top, and i don't see a delete button so i assume i just have to select all to delete. also as mentioned above, i run multi-day workshops with a dozen frames with different audiences on my corporate miro profile and there is no way i would just have one dedicated note for all those frames. if this feature exists it's not clear, though i need many separate notes so that i can pull up the right one for the right audience. i don't want to show the notes for my design team to the stakeholders when we are both looking at the same board.

the problem with this template is that it has all sort of fiddly bits that need to be deleted to be of any use.  and when i say fiddly, i really mean fiddly. because of the unnecessary ""cutesy"" zig-zag layout, mass selections are out of the question. the selection process itself has peculiar rules. i've been surprised at was was included in some of my selections, and had to undo a few delete actions.

as for the journey mapping template: the preview looked ideal. but then surprise-surprise: there's a whole lot of irrelevant junk to the left and right of what was shown in the preview. and i cannot easily just select and delete the garbage i don't want, because the cluttered design has elements running through all 3 ""sections"" of the template.

all i wanted to do was quickly jot down a few thoughts. but fighting with the very, very frustrating tool has resulted in me forgetting what i actually wanted to jot down in the first place. :'(",1

for those that might want to use skype, microsoft teams, google hangouts or hangouts meet instead, partner with those companies and add an integration too.

add some few pen types too like chalk texture, highlighter, pencil, whiteboard marker, even the rainbow and glitter pen on microsoft onenote, for more customization on annotation on miro. please develop a virtual pen pressure too based on the velocity of the drawing, so it's not just one stroke weight, and there's more reality to the annotation.

capitalize all your tooltips, it's trippin me out that they're all smallcaps.

3074457346629589540,"this is awesome...  great work everyone!   
i love the diagram contents in a grid... can't wait to have access to this via the sdk.. ;)

improvement:
the 'select edge of grid' in order to 'resize/scale the whole grid' is pretty intuitive... its echos the google apps / power point sort of ui  (which is ok, but i dont love --> #miroforever).   

at the point of a full grid selected state (lasso select all of grid and content- full grid and content selected with blue outline): add a corner or edge pull for either one or both dimension resize/scale. i think at this point the selection of the inner content of the cells would be deselected -- the logic being that we've transitioned to editing the grid... 

there's currently little else available to us to do with a whole grid and contents selection. plugins work. we might as well have the resize/scale available to us.  

----


i may have missed it in the tutorial.. but i'm not entirely sure what ""cell resize: auto | manual"" does...  maybe leave a small '?' icon near this item during beta?

pros: clean and simplified, coloring/formatting, ease of column/row edits, connecting cell contents via lines. 

cons: can't copy a cell on direct click (have to click inside to copy & paste), no vertical alignment, no double click on psuedo headers to auto-size on column width.

nice to have: auto-numbering for database designs, very basic formula/math to keep it minimal but useful...and more 🤔😀",4

3074457345847851183,"i think it was the most expected feature and it's working great as a first version!

that said, it would be great to have an option to align text inside a cell from top to bottom and also being able to rotate the text at least by 90º basis.

3074457347413548492,"i've wanted something like this for so long! love the ability to type right into the cell and/or place any objects within the cell. 
really powerful. i think it's a game changer and i'm thrilled! a few very minor thoughts:

- could be easier to add columns to the left or right—after clicking, the ""+"" controls are still at the ends of the grid, rather than right next to the selected column. obvs could be the same for rows.
- was expecting to be able to hit ""delete"" on the keyboard to delete a row or column.
- was expecting to be able to control the vertical alignment of text in a grid cell (top, middle, bottom).
- would be *super cool* if the grid cells could automatically organize elements the way a frame can switch between ""freeform"" and ""grid""

3074457346029473116,just wanted to say the grid is awesome. so useful. i just created a calendar and the tabbing behavior was exactly as i would want. tab on a cell and i go to the cell on the right and can type. tab at the last column and i go to the next row. tab on the last cell in the grid and i get a new row. so good. thank you.,5

3074457347201981577,"hello team miro, 

the ""visual notes"" section is absolutely great!!! you totally read my mind. although,  i am a new user, i have used several mind mapping / wireframe softwares and i'm pleasantly surprised with miro. 

with that said, i do have a quick suggestion related to the ""visual notes"" feature. i love that fact that you can copy a url from each created node and paste it within a note. once a user clicks on the url, it immediately zooms into the node in question.  however, it would be great if a user could see which nodes have any notes affiliated with them from a birds eyes view. 

for example, a small badge will appear on the upper right corner if a node has any ""notes"" affiliated to it. also if all the badges could be toggled on and off for better viewing purposes.  i have found this feature to be useful when navigating a mindmap of over 200 nodes. with a quick look, i can see which nodes have been assigned internal notes for me to read. thanks for the consideration and look forward to seeing any new developments related to the product. keep up the great work and hope all is well. 

sincerely, 
- ivan",5

one thing we lacked today: is it possible to have the row headers and column headers always visible? like an option? the issue is that we are always moving to see what the header title was.

,copy paste work counterintuitive (can't copy a whole row into a second grid). same font size inconsistent between grids.,2
,"it's very unhandy to resize the text within the wf components. also some more components would be amazing. the existing template doesn't have any added value for me within my workflow, but without it i wouldn't even have realized miro has the wireframing tools at all, as they are hidden in the ""more options"" menu.",2

3) better layer controls: send to front, send to back, photoshop-like layers that can be locked and unlocked easily
4) need to be able to shift-drag select locked elements (maybe shift+ctrl+drag)
5) grids are nice, but you can't drag one grid into another (child/parent)
6) auto sizing is nice, but it needs padding in the cells if i want
7) i like auto labling and easy text within grid cells. nice.
8) can't drag one grid object into another grid cell. the original dragged grid just pops back to where it was.  i expect it to act like any other object that can be dragged into a grid cell.  e.g. ""parent grid"" contains 6 cells, each representing a room that will hold a team.  within each team, there are a group of 4 leads (producer, artist, programmer, designer).  i need a grid for the leads to be draggable into each of the 6 rooms.  no dice.",2
