I like Miro for the voting plugin, drawing and shapes features because they help overcome the fear of drawing that business teams experience during ideation. I usually use Whimsical or whiteboard but I'm starting to facilitate remote design sprints and came across a post on social media.

I added the Remote 5-Day Design Sprint template to my board today, I've used Miro maybe 5-6 times in the past 6 months. As a newbie adding the template from a Facebook post, I assumed that the board would be a public document that I have to make a copy of to add to my board. The only other thing would be how slow it feels to use Miro compared to Whimsical. Sort of how Sketch used to feel compared XD, but Sketch improved the response time while really using the app so I'm sure you will too.

I can't wait to make Miro part of my core process. It would make onboarding new clients so much more efficient if I don't have to jump between Miro for remote design sprints and Whimsical for quick decision sessions.",7

You've come a long way since RealtimeBoard, and it's mind-blowing. My friends and I just keep finding more and more things to love and gush over about it!

Kanban boards are one of the most useful tools my team and I use. I'd love to see improvements to the way cards are displayed. Currently, there are only a couple of levels of font size for the cards, which makes it so I have to either zoom way in, or zoom OUT to easily read the card. Having more breakpoints for the font size based on zoom-level or otherwise scaling the text consistently would be huge.  I'd also like the little expand button that appears when hovering a card to appear even when zoomed further out. It might also be worth experimenting with cards that grow vertically when it has more text in it.

A pie-in-the-sky idea I'd love would be to have document objects on the board that functions as the Note feature with headers and formatting but are on the board itself and can be moved and sized. Having the Note functionality within a card's expanded view could also be quite useful.

Absolutely stunning work!",10
